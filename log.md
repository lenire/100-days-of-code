**Today's Progress**: Setup the environment, and determiend what I want to study. I have signed up for the Python course github offers and have started working on installing all the necessary tools to get it working.

I had to install a few modules in visual stuido code, and get things to function right because python wasnt installed, and git wasnt installed, even though i have the github desktop.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with how to close issues, but now i think I am getting the hang of it.
