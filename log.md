# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 15, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Finished the python course from Github. Well crap I thought that would take longer. I did run into some formatting issues, so it was nice to troubleshoot something other than email issues. I am now looking at the freecode camp course on Python, as I did not get much out of the Github course, besides some basic basic syntax. But now its done. so now what?

**Error I ran into**:  File "C:\Users\Simon Ponder\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\lib\runpy.py", line 239, 
in _get_code_from_file
    code = compile(f.read(), fname, 'exec')
  File "c:\Users\Simon Ponder\Documents\GitHub\python-random-quote\get-quote.py", line 10        
    rnd = random.randint(0, last)
    ^
IndentationError: unexpected indent

**solution**:delete the trailing characters and make it all one line, then hit enter for a hard return.

**Thoughts:** I solved it with playing around instead of googling. so thats cool.

**Today's Progress**: Setup the environment, and determiend what I want to study. I have signed up for the Python course github offers and have started working on installing all the necessary tools to get it working.

I had to install a few modules in visual stuido code, and get things to function right because python wasnt installed, and git wasnt installed, even though i have the github desktop.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with how to close issues, but now i think I am getting the hang of it.
